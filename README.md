## Notes

- Sets of Chinese simplified/traditional CJK characters are not limited to *official* ones, they may contain additional *hybrid* (combination of simplified and traditional components) and *extended* (same component substitution pattern) characters.

- Likewise, although sets of Japanese shinjitai/kyūjitai CJK characters are generally not *rule-based*, they may be *extended* by following plausible substitution patterns, and considered related as well.
